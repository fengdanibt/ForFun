  abstract = {Creating accurate computational models of human decision making is a vital step towards the realization of socially intelligent systems capable of both predicting and simulating human behavior. In modeling human decision making, a key factor is the psychological phenomenon known as ``framing'', in which the preferences of a decision maker change in response to contextual changes in decision problems. Existing approaches treat framing as a one-dimensional contextual influence based on the perception of outcomes as either gains or losses. However, empirical studies have shown that framing effects are much more multifaceted than one-dimensional views of framing suggest. To address this limitation, we propose an integrative approach to modeling framing which combines the psychological principles of cognitive appraisal theories and decision-theoretic notions of utility and probability. We show that this approach allows for both the identification and computation of the salient contextual factors in a decision as well as modeling how they ultimately affect the decision process. Furthermore, we show that our multi-dimensional, appraisal-based approach can account for framing effects identified in the empirical literature which cannot be addressed by one-dimensional theories, thereby promising more accurate models of human behavior.},

abstract= {Cognitive appraisal theories, which link human emotional experience to their interpretations of events happening in the environment, are leading approaches to model emotions. Cognitive appraisal theories have often been used both for simulating "real emotions" in virtual characters and for predicting the human user’s emotional experience to facilitate human–computer interaction. In this work, we investigate the computational modeling of appraisal in a multi-agent decision-theoretic framework using Partially Observable Markov Decision Process-based (POMDP) agents. Domain-independent approaches are developed for five key appraisal dimensions (motivational relevance, motivation congruence, accountability, control and novelty). We also discuss how the modeling of theory of mind (recursive beliefs about self and others) is realized in the agents and is critical for simulating social emotions. Our model of appraisal is applied to three different scenarios to illustrate its usages. This work not only provides a solution for computationally modeling emotion in POMDPbased agents, but also illustrates the tight relationship between emotion and cognition—the appraisal dimensions are derived from the processes and information required for the agent’s decision-making and beliefmaintenance processes, which suggests a uniform cognitive structure for emotion and cognition},

abstract= {Gaze is an extremely powerful expressive signal that is used for many purposes,
from expressing emotion to regulating human interaction. The use of gaze as 
a signal has been exploited to strong effect in hand-animated characters, greatly enhancing
the believability of the character’s simulated life. However, virtual humans 
animated in real-time have been less successful at using expressive gaze. One reason 
for this is that a gaze shift towards any speciﬁc target can be performed in many 
different ways, using many different expressive manners of gaze, each of which can 
potentially imply a different emotional or cognitive internal state. However, there is 
currently no mapping that describes how a user will attribute these internal states to 
a virtual character performing a gaze shift in a particular manner. In this paper, we 
begin to address this by providing the results of an empirical study that explores the 
mapping between an observer’s attribution of emotional state to gaze. The purpose of 
this mapping is to allow for an interactive virtual human to generate believable gaze 
shifts that a user will attribute a desired emotional state to. We have generated a set of 
animations by composing low-level gaze attributes culled from the nonverbal behavior 
literature. Then, subjects judged the animations displaying these attributes. While the 
results do not provide a complete mapping between gaze and emotion, they do provide 
a basis for a generative model of expressive gaze.},

abstract = {Cognitive appraisal theories, which link human emotional
experience to their interpretations of events happening in the environment, are leading approaches to model emotions. In this paper, we investigate the computational modeling of appraisal in a multi-agent decision-
theoretic framework using POMDP based agents. We illustrate how
B/ve key appraisal dimensions (motivational relevance, motivation congruence, accountability, control and novelty) can be derived from the
processes and information required for the agent's decision-making and
belief maintenance. Through this illustration, we not only provide a solution for computationally modeling emotion in POMDP based agents,
but also demonstrate the tight relationship between emotion and cognition. Our model of appraisal is applied to three diB.erent scenarios to
illustrate its usage. We also discuss how the modeling of theory of mind
(recursive beliefs about self and others) is critical for simulating social
emotions.},

We present a framework for modeling the psychological phenomenon of self-deception in a decision-theoretic framework. Specifically, we model the self-deceptive behavior of wishful thinking as a psychological bias towards the belief in a particularly desirable situation or state. By leveraging the structures and axioms of expected utility (EU) we are able to operationalize both the determination and the application of the desired belief state with respect to the decision-making process of expected utility maximization. While we categorize our framework as a descriptive model of human decision making, we show that when specific errors are present, the realized expected utility of an action biased by wishful thinking can exceed that of an action motivated purely by the maximization of expected utility. Finally, in order to provide a descriptive characterization of our framework, we present a discussion of wishful thinking with respect to the Certainty Effect and the Allais Paradox, two specific documented inconsistencies of human behavior. In this discussion we show that our framework has the descriptive flexibility needed to account for both the Certainty Effect and Allais Paradoxes.},

abstract = {Gaze is an extremely important aspect of human face
to face interaction. Over the course of an interaction,
a single individual’s gaze can perform many different
functions, such as regulating communication, expressing
emotion, and attending to task performance. When
gaze shifts occur, where they are directed, and how
they are performed all provide critical information to
an observer of the gaze shift. The goal of this work is to
allow virtual humans to mimic the gaze capabilities of
humans in face to face interaction. This paper introduces
the SmartBody Gaze Controller (SBGC), a highly
versatile framework for realizing various manners of
gaze through a rich set of input parameters. Using these
parameters, the SBCG controls aspects of movement
such as velocity, postural bias, and the selection of
joints committed to a particular gaze task. We provide a
preliminary implementation that demonstrates how related
work on the Expressive Gaze Model (EGM) can
be used to inform management of these input parameters.
The EGM is a model for manipulating the style of
gaze shifts for the purpose of expressing emotion.
The SBGC is fully compatible with all aspects of the
SmartBody system.},

To build a believable virtual human, it is imperative to construct a gaze model that generates realistic gaze behaviors. However, it is not enough to merely imitate a person's eye movements. The gaze behaviors should reflect the internal states of the virtual human and users should be able to derive them by observing the behaviors. In this paper, we present a gaze model driven by the cognitive operations; the model processes the virtual human's reasoning, dialog management, and goals to generate behaviors that reflect the agent's inner thoughts. It has been implemented into our virtual human system and operates in real-time. The gaze model introduced in this paper was originally designed and developed by Jeff Rickel but has since been extended by the authors.},

The characters motivations are encoded as the agents goals, and are configured based on well-structured story paths generated using a partial order planner. This framework allows the use of a planner that models the story at a more abstract level than the multi-agent system, and thus avoids the effort of building equivalent models of the story using both the planner and the multi-agent system. We explore the use of this new framework for authoring interactive dramas. Preliminary examples of application are presented.},

	abstract = {Interactive drama allows people to participate actively in a
dynamically unfolding story, by playing a character or by exerting directorial control. One of the central challenges faced in the design of
interactive dramas is how to ensure that the author's goals for the user's
narrative experience are achieved in the face of the user's actions in the
story. This challenge is especially significant when a variety of users are
expected. To address this challenge, we present an extension to Thespian,
an authoring and simulating framework for interactive dramas. Each virtual character is controlled by a decision-theoretic goal driven agent. In
our previous work on Thespian, we provided a semi-automated authoring approach that allows authors to configure virtual characters' goals
through specifying story paths. In this work, we extend Thespian into a
more proactive authoring framework to further reduce authoring effort.
The approach works by simulating potential users' behaviors, generating corresponding story paths, filtering the generated paths to identify
those that seem problematic and prompting the author to verify virtual
characters' behaviors in them. The author can correct virtual characters'
behaviors by modifying story paths. As new story paths are designed by
the author, the system incrementally adjusts virtual characters' configurations to reflect the author's design ideas. Overall, this enables interactive testing and refinement of an interactive drama. The details of this
approach will be presented in this paper, followed by preliminary results
of applying it in authoring an interactive drama.},

	abstract = {There has been a growing interest in designing multi-agent based
interactive dramas. A key research challenge faced in the design of
these systems is to support open-ended user interaction while ensuring
dramatic user experiences and consistent character personalities.
Autonomous agents with reactive and planning abilities are
well suited for realizing characters that both adapt to user interactions
and are consistent with their own goals. However, agents are
often created manually and with extensive programming effort, that
excludes authoring by non-technical authors. Thespian is a framework
for realizing interactive drama that seeks to reduce programming
effort. To start, an author provides linear scripts of the drama.
An automated fitting algorithm then configures agents to behave
according to the scripts via automated tuning of goal parameters.
This capability allows authors to design in a familiar way by writing
scripts. Thespian also supports reuse of characters and story
elements. Given these advantages, new scenarios can be developed
with less programming effort. We discuss the use of Thespian in
fitting characters in the Tactical Language Training System and in
a Grimms' fairy tale. We also present preliminary experiments on
migrating characters between these stories.},

a wide variety of computer-based learning environments. However, the effort required
to build interactive dramas is quite significant. We built Thespian, an architecture
that supports faster development of IPDs, open-ended interaction, encoding
of pedagogical goals and quantitative metrics for evaluating those goals. Thespian
uses autonomous agents to control each character and assumes that the starting
point for the design process is a set of standard scripts. A fitting. algorithm facilitates
the design process by automatically adjusting the goals of the agents so that
the agents perform their roles according to the scripts. This also ensures the agents
will behave true to their character's motivations even when the interactive drama
deviates from the scripts. In this paper, we discuss this basic approach in detail and
illustrate its application to the Tactical Language Training System.},
